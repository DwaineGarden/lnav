title: Added "lo-fi" mode
excerpt: An alternative way to copy displayed text.
---

*(This change is in v0.7.2+)*

Copying text to the clipboard can be done by marking lines with the
[bookmark hotkeys](https://docs.lnav.org/en/latest/hotkeys.html#bookmarks),
like `m`, and then pressing `c`.  Commands that write to a file,
like [`:write-csv-to`](https://docs.lnav.org/en/latest/commands.html#write-csv-to-path)
accept `/dev/clipboard` as a way to write to the clipboard.  However, if the
native clipboard isn't supported, or you're on an SSH connection, you can
now switch to "lo-fi" mode.  In "lo-fi" mode, lnav drops out of the curses
display and prints the raw text to the terminal.  You can switch to "lo-fi"
mode in a view by pressing `CTRL-L`.  For commands, you can use a dash `-`
to switch to "lo-fi" and print to standard out.
