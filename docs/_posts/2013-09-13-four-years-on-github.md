The [first commit](https://github.com/tstack/lnav/commit/b4ec432515e95e86ec9d711833b8cb34d0912546)
to the [lnav repository](https://github.com/tstack/lnav) was four years ago
today!  I started working on lnav a couple of years before that, but this was
its first public appearance. I still use it every day and plan to keep things
going for years to come.
